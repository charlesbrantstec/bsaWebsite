Do we want any user to sign up?
    Yes - Open to malicious signing up (unlikely/can be avoided with DB user limit)
    No - Only admins could sign up users, send out invite codes (more complicated)

Do we want to only let users sign up with an authorized code?

Do we want users to have a username and email?
    email is more practical in place of username
    email is readily on file and already associated with clients and used by bsa for contacting clients

Do we want a signup confirmation sent to their email address?

Do we want to pre sign up clients?

*** SIMPLEST SOLUTION ***

Let anybody sign up, have db limit of 300?, send confirmation email
confirmation email serves 2 purposes: validating correct email & notifying users that are pre-signed up by admins
